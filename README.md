# C-sharp-challenges
As I learn C#, I am using a Codecademy Challenge Index made by a moderator called alexc to strenghten my knowledge and usage of C#. If you spot any mistake or have any suggestion concerning my works, I would be happy to hear from you!

14-12-21 update: I decided to pause my C# learning for several reasons. 
The first one is that I am learning C# for videogame making and I do not have a proper work station with enough power for the moment.
Furthermore, the second reason is that I am currently looking for a new job and HTML/CSS is a better language for my work field (digital marketing).
